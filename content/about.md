As Tracy Letts says in The Big Short, welcome to my academic 'dinky webpage'. My academic interests are in Condensed Matter Physics. Currently, for my hobby I am getting into HAM (not the food), and experimenting with designing and taping out analog/RF integrated circuits.

## Background

I'm a recent graduate (MSc Semiconductors and Microelectronics, Purdue University, 2025). My academic journey wasn't the most linear, but just like my interests, it was diverse and incredibly rewarding. My current focus is lithographic reserach, but I am incredibly curious about RF and analog chip design, radars, and system design. I try to practice the latter in my spare time, when my ideas about physics and lithography dry up.

Besides my academic interests, I enjoy reading philosophy (which I discuss with a friend of mine), watching movies, and practicing any possible physical activity. 

## Current Interests

- **Research Focus:** Condensed matter physics, semiconductor device physics
- **Hobby Projects:** HAM radio, analog/RF integrated circuit design and tape-out
- **Open Source:** Contributing to IC design tools and methodologies
