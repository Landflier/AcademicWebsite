As Tracy Letts says in The Big Short, welcome to my academic 'dinky webpage'. My academic interests are in Condensed Matter Physics. Currently, for my hobby I am getting into HAM (not the food), and experimenting with designing and taping out analog/RF integrated circuits. 

## Education

- MSc Semiconductors and Microelectronics, Purdue University, 2025
- M1 Genral Physics, University Paris-Saclay, 2023
- BSc Theoretical Physics, University of Glasgow, 2022

## Work experience
I graduated recently (May 2025), and have decided to pursue a PhD. Throughout my university years I proactivaly looked for opportunities to conduct Solid-State Physics related research. Below I have summerized my most recent positions:

imec, 03.2024 - 09.2024
Department of Experimental Materials and Material Transfer

Project: Polymer residue cleaning from 2D materials
Supervisor: Dr. Jean-Francois de Marneffe
Research and responsibilities: 
Developed rigorous testing protocols to compare plasma etching and UV curing 
Proactively sought to expand the cross-team collaborations to explore different approaches
Created my own automation scripts for experiment description and book-keeping using JS and Obsidian 

imec, 04.2023 - 09.2023
Department of Experimental Photolithography Materials, MSc project

Project: EUV electronic processes in photoresists
Supervisors: Dr. Roberto Fallica, Prof Stefano Nannarone
Research and responsibilities:
Collaborated with chemists and physicists to understand and improve the in-house model
Wrote extensive project and code documentation using Jekyll

CNRS
C2N, research internship

Project: MEMS transducer for wireless power transfer in medical implants
Supervisor: Prof. Elie Lefeuvre
Research and responsibilities: 
compared Terfenol-D and Galfenol in terms of device power
designed a novel Bayesian methodology to consolidate findings
wrote Python code to automate the experimental process

Some of my other jobs include part-time teaching at a local school, and interning at GlobalFoundries.
