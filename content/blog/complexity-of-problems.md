# RF is also light
Recently, my thinking has been occupied with how complex our current-day societal problems have become. It seems, the more our knowledge matures and progresses, the smaller the radius of each new piece of knowledge becomes. This shrinkage is something that bothers and scares me, as my current belief is that complex challenges require a multi-pronged appoach, involving repeated exploration using a variety of thought-frameworks. To give an example from my personal experience: the other day I was thinking about lithography and an issue I am trying to solve. This issues is connected with the nature of light-matter interaction. Concurrently, I was reading the radar textbook by Skolnik, and it suddenly dawned on me, that all forms of communication we use in our daily lives (WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS, etc), are actually light! Although trivial, this realization surprised me - how could this obvious fact occur to me so late? 

The moral of the story for me is the following: looking at subjects from different angles illuminates in surprising ways many points we assume or take for granted. Such realizaiton, although initially trival, can become profound if the exercize of unraveling them is repeated a sufficient number of times.

# How to think about problems in a multitude of ways

Currently, I don't have a system inplace to explain how to practice this multi-pronged appoach. Maybe having a system for everything is stupid anyway. However, I do have some role-models and sources which I believe do this in an excellent way. 

- Kant in his "Critique of Pure Reason" - Kant is an absolute master at disentagling complex issues and presenting the various important crux thoughts in a clear and concise manner. I believe every researcher and thought-worker should read him, given they first read some prerequisites (even only Decartes' "Meditations" and Spinoza's "Ethics").
- P A M Dirac - in my field of physics, I have never enjoyed reading someone's research thinking more than Dirac's. His sentence structures should be studied carefully, giving special attention to the flow of thought, of which he is a mater.
- L. Susskind - I really enjoy his teaching style. He brings a very calm analysis to some tough topics, and listening to his expositions is soothing and makes you believe you understood everything (in fact you haven't, and need to practice the concepts).

# How I currently try to contextualize problems

I have noticed, most of the problems in science and industry have become quite specific and complex (mature fields). Therefore, my first approach to such problems is to ask what would be the perfect solution. Or what would be the ideal method to solve the problem. I like this approach as it clearly reveals at the very beginning what are the important aspects of the problem. It also reveals what are the challenges, and clearly sets out a vision to solving them.
