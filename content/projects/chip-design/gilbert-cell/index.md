## Project Overview

This project involves the design and implementation of a Gilbert cell mixer for RF applications as part of the 2025 Chipathon organized by the IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society (SSCS). The work encompasses RF circuit design, layout implementation, verification, and comprehensive performance characterization using the GF180MCU process technology.

## Objectives

- Design a high-performance Gilbert cell mixer for RF frequency conversion
- Implement the design using the GF180MCU PDK and industry-standard EDA tools
- Perform comprehensive verification including DRC, LVS, and RF performance analysis
- Optimize the design for gain, linearity, and noise performance
- Participate in the IEEE SSCS Chipathon initiative and document the complete design methodology

## Methodology

### Circuit Design
The Gilbert cell mixer was designed using Cadence Virtuoso, focusing on:
- **Architecture selection**: Classic Gilbert cell topology for balanced mixing
- **Transistor sizing**: Optimized for conversion gain and linearity
- **Bias network design**: Stable current sources and voltage references
- **RF matching**: Input/output impedance matching for 50Ω systems

### Layout Implementation
The physical layout was implemented following RF design principles:
- **Floorplanning**: Symmetrical layout for balanced operation
- **RF routing**: Minimized parasitics and maintained signal integrity
- **Ground plane**: Solid ground plane for low-noise performance
- **Design rule compliance**: Adherence to GF180MCU PDK design rules

### Verification & Analysis
Comprehensive verification was performed including:
- **Design Rule Check (DRC)**: Verified layout compliance with GF180MCU rules
- **Layout vs. Schematic (LVS)**: Confirmed layout matches schematic netlist
- **Parasitic extraction**: RF parasitic extraction including inductances
- **RF simulation**: S-parameter analysis and harmonic distortion characterization
- **Noise analysis**: Noise figure and signal-to-noise ratio optimization

## Results

### Performance Metrics
- **RF frequency**: 2.4 GHz
- **LO frequency**: 2.3 GHz
- **IF frequency**: 100 MHz
- **Conversion gain**: 12 dB
- **Input P1dB**: -8 dBm
- **IIP3**: +2 dBm
- **Noise figure**: 9 dB
- **Power consumption**: 8 mW at 1.8V supply
- **Area**: 0.25 mm²

### Key Achievements
- Achieved target conversion gain with excellent linearity
- Low noise figure suitable for receiver applications
- Successful first-pass design with all specifications met
- Balanced layout ensuring good common-mode rejection
- Ready for fabrication through Chipathon initiative

## Technical Challenges

### RF Layout Challenges
The most significant challenge was maintaining RF performance in the layout:
- Symmetrical transistor matching for balanced operation
- Minimizing parasitic capacitances and inductances
- Proper ground plane implementation
- Isolation between RF and DC bias networks

### Performance Optimization
Achieving target performance required:
- Careful transistor sizing for optimal transconductance
- Bias current optimization for linearity vs. power trade-off
- Load impedance tuning for maximum conversion gain
- Noise optimization through proper device selection
