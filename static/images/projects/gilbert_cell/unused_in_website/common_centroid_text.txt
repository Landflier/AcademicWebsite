Table 13.2

The five rules of common-centroid layout for MOS transistors.

 

1. COINCIDENCE: The centroids of the matched MOS transistors should coincide at least approximately. Ideally, the centroids
should exactly coincide.

2. SYMMETRY: The array should be symmetric around both the horizontal and vertical axes.

3. DISPERSION: When possible, a large array should be subdivided into as many smaller arrays as possible that each satisfy
the rules of coincidence and symmetry. If this can be achieved, then the larger array need not satisfy these rules; only the
subarrays that comprise it need do so.

4, COMPACTNESS: The array (or each of its subarrays) should be as compact as possible.

5. ORIENTATION: Matched MOS transistors should possess equal orientations.
